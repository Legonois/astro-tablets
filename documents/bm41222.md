Because there are only a few observations associated with each king, the
results are not highly conclusive by themselves. However, if we were to
assume that Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years and Kandalanu 22 years
(actually 21, and a year with no king), then we can test the results as
a group:

These results differ very marginally from Hunger \[2, p. 151\] who
starts Shamash-shum-ukin’s 17th year one month earlier in March instead
of April, and therefore obtains `19/II/17 = -650 April 28`, I consider
either option to be a good match.
