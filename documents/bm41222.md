Results
-------

Because there are only a few observations associated with each king, the
data is not sufficiently unique to produce any conclusive year for each
king’s reign independently.

However, given that we know Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years and
Kandalanu 22 years (actually 21, and a year with no king), we can test
the results as a sequential group.

When testing years in the range -726 to -576 the best match for
Shamash-shum-ukin’s 14th year is -653:
