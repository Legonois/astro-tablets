Observations
------------

> The text lists the dates of successive first and last visibilities of
> Saturn in terms of the regnal year, month and day in the lunar
> calendar.

> The planet is nowhere named on the tablet, but the intervals between
> the various observations (both chronologically and in terms of
> ecliptic longitude) fit the movements of Saturn and of no other
> planet.

Results
-------

When testing years in the range -697 to -596 the best match for
Kandalanu’s 1st year is -646, it is obviously very close at the top, but
in the context of the other texts in this project the -646 date matches
up.
