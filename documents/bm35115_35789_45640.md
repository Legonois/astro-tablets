Chronology
----------

According to H Hunger \[3, p. 391\] this tablet is part of a series that
are:

> arranged in columns such that each entry in a column is separated from
> the entry in the preceding column by one Saros of 18 years

We can therefore deduce the length of Shamash-shum-ukin’s reign as 20
years long (based on Col IV’. 1 and Col V’. 1).

Results
-------

When testing years in the range -720 to -617 the best match for
Shamash-shum-ukin’s Accession year is -667.

</table>

My results match those of H Hunger \[3, p. 395\], except for the eclipse
in Oct -667 which Hunger has as the 23rd, I believe this is likely to be
a typographical error since the only lunar eclipse in October was
definitely on the 25th (see [NASA’s eclipse
catalog](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE-0699--0600.html)).
