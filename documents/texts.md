Introduction to the Babylonian Astronomical Texts
=================================================

Calendar
--------

> The Babylonians used a luni-solar calendar. The day began at sunset,
> and each month began on the night when the lunar cresent was first
> visible. There were twelve months in most years, each month lasting
> for 29 or 30 days. To regulate the seasons, an intercalary month was
> inserted when necessary. \[1, p. 338\]

### Lunar Year

> The beginning of the year, day 1 of Nisannu (month I), always fell
> within about 30 days of the vernal equinox \[2, p. 131\]

The year could either have 12 or 13 months depending on if there was an
intercalary month. Prior to Nabopolassar the complete arrangement of
intercalary months is not fully known, but I am using this list of
confirmed intercalary months \[3, p. 67\]:

-   Shamash-shum-ukin Year 14, Addaru II: BM 29496, YBC 11309
-   Kandalanu Year 5, Ululu II: Clay BE 8/1, No.3,
    [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md#translation) Obv. 10
-   Kandalanu Year 8, Ululu II:
    [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md#translation) Obv. 15
-   Kandalanu Year 10, Addaru II: BM 54213,
    [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md#translation) Rev. 20
-   Kandalanu Year 19, Addaru II: YBC 11481, 11300, 11476, NBC 6144

From the reign of Nabopolassar onwards all the intercalary months are
documented by Parker and Dubberstein \[4, p. 4\].

### Lunar Month

> Day 1 of the new month was declared at the first appearance of the
> lunar crescent after sunset… The only attested month lengths are 29
> days and 30 days, because day 1 was declared no later than the sunset
> at the end of day 30, irrespective of whether the crescent was then
> observed or not. \[2, p. 131\]

In order to compute the start of the month I am using the following
lunar visibility parameter:

> Our calculation shows that 7.5° (±0.25 ̊) is the lowest naked eye
> visibility limit. \[5, p. 58\]

Planetary Visibilty
-------------------

When computing planetary visibility events I am using the default fixed
arcus visionis parameters that are used in Alcyone Planetary, Stellar
and Lunar Visibility \[6\].

Conversions
-----------

### Angular Separation

> Our results for the angular equivalent of the finger and cubit in the
> Neo-Babylonian period are respectively 0.092 and 2.2 deg \[7, p. 212\]

Where the diaries translate to “halo” I will map this to a 22° radius.

> The larger type of halo called supūru is not so far attested in
> diaries. \[8, p. 33\]

### Constellations

Where the tablets describe a body as being within a constellation, I
will approximate that position by drawing an appropriate radius around a
relatively central star within that constellation. It is only possible
to take an approximate approach anyway given that the boundaries for
ancient constellations have not been strictly defined.

Translations
------------

The general conventions used for most of the translations \[8, p. 37\]:

-   Square brackets `[]` denote missing/reconstructed text
-   Half brackets `⌜⌝` denote text damaged in some other way
-   A question mark indicates doubts about the reading of a sign

As a general rule I will not rely on reconstructed text for use in
analysing the observations; I will treat those sections as if they were
missing. There are some exceptions to this, such as where it is possible
to deduce information about the missing text from its surroundings, for
example:

-   Where a year/month/day number is missing or damaged I will assume
    that if the text is in order then the missing number will fit within
    the range of adjacent lines
-   [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md) follows a consistent pattern where
    every other line is the last/first appearance, and every two lines
    spans a year.

Time
----

1 UŠ (“time degree”) = 4 minutes; 1 bēru = 30 UŠ \[9\] \[8, p. 16\]

Eclipses
--------

> Observations of eclipses by the Babylonian astronomers usually contain
> the time of the eclipse measured relative to sunset or sunrise, the
> approximate entrance angle of the shadow, and an estimate of the
> eclipse magnitude. In many reports the duration of the individual
> phases of the eclipse are also given. \[10, p. 120\]

> It is characteristic for the record of the observation to end with a
> time. This may be understood as referring to the time of first
> contact. \[10, p. 120\]

> The eclipse records also contain descriptions of lunar eclipses that
> proved invisible at Babylon. These descriptions must then be
> predictions rather than observations. Usually it is possible to
> distinguish a predicted eclipse from an observation by the terminology
> used. \[10, p. 121\]

Some reports include measurements of the eclipse phases, including the
time to maximal phase (onset), duration of maximal phase (totality), and
time from the end of maximal phase to the end of the eclipse (clearing),
or the total length the eclipse which is the sum of all three phases.
\[8, p. 24\]

In the case of a total lunar eclipse, the onset is the time from when
the moon becomes partially eclipsed (1:2) to the start of the full
eclipse, the maximal phase is the time in which it is fully eclipsed
(2:3), and the clearing is the time until it is no longer partially
eclipsed (3:4) \[1, p. 341\]: ![](graphics/total_eclipse.png)

In the case of partial eclipses it is less straightforward, I can
measure the time from the start of the partial eclipse until it becomes
maximal (i.e. nearest separation of the moon and the shadow) (1:M), and
the time from then to the end of the eclipse (M:4). But because there is
a continuous curve, it is difficult to define a maximal phase
“duration”: ![](graphics/partial_eclipse.png)

Therefore in the case of partial eclipses I am only considering the
total eclipse duration.
