Square brackets `[]` denote missing/reconstructed text, a question mark
indicates doubts about the reading of a sign \[3, p. 37\].

Observations
------------

Since the text is missing I will allow Col.i. Line 1 to refer to any
month, the only assumption being made is that the text is part of a
single year.

Col.i. Line 7  
Month A, day 14:  
`Mercury's last appearance in the east behind Pisces` (ML)

Col.i. Line 8  
Month A, day 14:  
`Saturn's last appearance behind Pisces` (LA)

Col.i. Line 10-11  
Month A, day 17:  
`Mars became stationary in the area of the Lip of the Scorpion, it came close to the bright star of the Scorpion's head`

Col.iv. Line 7  
Month B, day 5:  
`Mercury's first appearance in the east in Pisces` (MF)

Col.iv. Line 14-15  
Month B, day 19:  
`Venus stood in the region of Aries, 10 fingers behind Mars`

Col.iv. Line 15-16  
Month B, day 20:  
`Mars was 1 finger to the left of the front? of Aries`

These results match with the work of Sachs and Hunger \[3, p. 47\]:

> This date \[-651\] is independently confirmed by the following
> astronomical events mentioned in the present diary: Last appearance of
> Mercury in the east behind Pisces and last appearance of Saturn behind
> Pisces (both around the 14th of month I); stationary point of Mars in
> Scorpius (17th of month I); first appearance of Mercury in Pisces (5th
> of month XII).

Chronology
----------

Notice in the month matched to Addaru (Col. iv):

    17' [....] .... The 27th, a rainbow whose brightness was very great stretched in the east.
    18' [.... in] Hiritu in the province of Sippar the troops of Babylonia and of Assyria fou[ght with each] other, and the troops of Babylonia withdrew and were heavily defeated.

Now compare with the Akitu Chronicle \[4, p. 131\] (BM 86379 \[5\]):

    9 The sixteenth year of Shamash-shumaukin:
      ...
    13 On the twenty-seventh day of Adar the armies of Assyria and Akkad
    14 did battle in Hirit. The army of Akkad
    15 retreated from the battlefield and a major defeat was inflicted upon them.

> There is no doubt that these sources are describing the same battle,
> since the date, place, identities of the combatants, and name of the
> winner match. \[6, p. 96\]

The tablet can therefore be dated to Šamaš-šumu-ukīn year 16 \[3, p.
47\]
