## Chronology

According to H Hunger [@hunger2001adt, 391] this tablet is part of a series that are:

> arranged in columns such that each entry in a column is separated from the entry in the preceding column by one Saros of 18 years

So although the regnal names are missing in columns IV and V, they can just be computed as continuations of Nebuchadnezzar's reign.
