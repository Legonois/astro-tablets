## Observations

Since the text is missing I will allow Col.i. Line 1 to refer to any month, the only
assumption being made is that the text is part of a single year.

Col.i. Line 7\
Month A, day 14:\
`Mercury's last appearance in the east behind Pisces` (ML)

Col.i. Line 8\
Month A, day 14:\
`Saturn's last appearance behind Pisces` (LA)

Col.i. Line 10-11\
Month A, day 17:\
`Mars became stationary in the area of the Lip of the Scorpion, it came close to the bright star of the Scorpion's head`

Col.iv. Line 7\
Month B, day 5:\
`Mercury's first appearance in the east in Pisces` (MF)

Col.iv. Line 14-15\
Month B, day 19:\
`Venus stood in the region of Aries, 10 fingers behind Mars`

These results match with the work of Sachs and Hunger [@sachs1988adt, 47]:

> This date [-651] is independently confirmed by the
> following astronomical events mentioned in the present diary:
> Last appearance of Mercury
> in the east behind Pisces and last appearance of Saturn behind Pisces (both around
> the 14th of month I); stationary point of Mars in Scorpius (17th of month I); first
> appearance of Mercury in Pisces (5th of month XII).

## Chronology

Notice in the month matched to Addaru (Col. iv):
```
17' [....] .... The 27th, a rainbow whose brightness was very great stretched in the east.
18' [.... in] Hiritu in the province of Sippar the troops of Babylonia and of Assyria fou[ght with each] other, and the troops of Babylonia withdrew and were heavily defeated.
```

Now compare with the Akitu Chronicle [@grayson1975assyrian, 131] (BM 86379 [@bm86379]):
```
9 The sixteenth year of Shamash-shumaukin:
  ...
13 On the twenty-seventh day of Adar the armies of Assyria and Akkad
14 did battle in Hirit. The army of Akkad
15 retreated from the battlefield and a major defeat was inflicted upon them.
```

According to Brinkman [@brinkman1990babylonian, 96]:

> There is no doubt that these sources are describing the same battle, since the date,
> place, identities of the combatants, and name of the winner match.

The tablet can therefore be dated to Shamash-shum-ukin year 16 [@sachs1988adt, 47].
