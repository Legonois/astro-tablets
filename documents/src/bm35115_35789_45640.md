## Chronology

According to H Hunger [@hunger2001adt, 391] this tablet is part of a series that are:

> arranged in columns such that each entry in a column is separated from the entry in the preceding column by one Saros of 18 years

We can therefore deduce the length of Shamash-shum-ukin's reign as 20 years long (based on Col IV'. 1 and Col V'. 1).

## Results

When testing years in the range -697 to -596 the best match for Shamash-shum-ukin’s Accession year is -667.

My results match those of H Hunger [@hunger2001adt, 395], except for the eclipse in Oct -667 which Hunger has
as the 23rd, I believe this is likely to be a typographical error since the only lunar eclipse in October was definitely
on the 25th (see [NASA's eclipse catalog](https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/LEcat5/LE-0699--0600.html)).
