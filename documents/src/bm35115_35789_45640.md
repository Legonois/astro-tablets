## Chronology

According to H Hunger [@hunger2001adt, 391] this tablet is part of a series that are:

> arranged in columns such that each entry in a column is separated from the entry in the preceding column by one Saros of 18 years

We can therefore deduce the length of Shamash-shum-ukin's reign as 20 years long (based on Col IV'. 1 and Col V'. 1).
