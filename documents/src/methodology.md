## Calendar

### Lunar Year

> The beginning of the year, day 1 of Nisannu (month I), always fell within about 30 days of the vernal equinox
> [@ossendrijver2016translating, 131]

The year could either have 12 or 13 months depending on if there was an intercalary month. 
I am using this list of known intercalary months:

- Shamash-shum-ukin Year 14, Addaru II: BM 29496, YBC 11309
- Kandalanu Year 5, Ululu II: Clay BE 8/1, No.3, [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md#translation) Obv. 10
- Kandalanu Year 8, Ululu II: [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md#translation) Obv. 15
- Kandalanu Year 10, Addaru II: BM 54213, [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md#translation) Rev. 20
- Kandalanu Year 19, Addaru II: YBC 11481, 11300, 11476, NBC 6144
- Nabopolassar Year 2, Addaru II: NCBT 589
- Nabopolassar Year 5, Ululu II: UET IV 202
- Nabopolassar Year 7, Addaru II: YBC 3455
- Nabopolassar Year 10, Ululu II: GCCI II 50, NBC 6141
- Nabopolassar Year 12, Addaru II: Unpub. economic text (Sachs)
- Nabopolassar Year 15, Ululu II: TCL XII 19, NCBT 1175

### Lunar Month

> Day 1 of the new month was declared at the first appearance of the lunar crescent after sunset...
> The only attested month lengths are 29 days and 30 days, because day 1 was declared no later than the sunset at the
> end of day 30, irrespective of whether the crescent was then observed or not. 
> [@ossendrijver2016translating, 131]

> Our calculation shows that 7.5° (±0.25 ̊) is the lowest naked eye visibility limit.
> [@sultan2007visibility, 58]

I will take into account the following constraints:

- The month may not start earlier than the first possible day of lunar visibility, however it may start one day later.
- Each month can either be 29 or 30 days long (unless a dated text confirms the month was 30 days long).

## Planetary Visibilty

When computing planetary visibility events I am using the default fixed arcus visionis parameters
that are used in Alcyone Planetary, Stellar and Lunar Visibility [@alcyoneplsv].

## Conversions

### Angular Separation

> Our results for the angular equivalent of the finger and cubit in the Neo-Babylonian period are respectively 0.092 
> and 2.2 deg
> [@fatoohi1997angular, 212]

Where the diaries translate to "halo" I will map this to a 22° radius.

> The larger type of halo called supūru is not so far attested in diaries.
> [@sachs1988adt, 33]

### Constellations

Where the tablets describe a body as being within a constellation, I will approximate that position
by drawing an appropriate radius around a relatively central star within that constellation. We can only take an
approximate approach anyway given that we do not have strict boundaries for the ancient constellations.

## Translations

The general conventions used for most of the translations [@sachs1988adt, 37]:

- Square brackets `[]` denote missing/reconstructed text
- Half brackets `⌜⌝` denote text damaged in some other way
- A question mark indicates doubts about the reading of a sign

As a general rule I will not rely on reconstructed text for use in analysing the observations; I will treat those
sections as if they were missing. There are some exceptions to this, such as where it is possible to deduce information
about the missing text from its surroundings, for example:

- Where a year/month/day number is missing or damaged we can assume that if the text is in order then the missing
  number will fit within the range of adjacent lines
- [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md) follows a consistent pattern where every other line is the last/first appearance, 
  and every two lines spans a year.

## Time

1 UŠ ("time degree") = 4 minutes; 1 bēru = 30 UŠ [@stephenson1994babylonian] [@sachs1988adt, 16]
