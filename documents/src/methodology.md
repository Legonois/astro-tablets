## Calendar

### Lunar Year

> The beginning of the year, day 1 of Nisannu (month I), always fell within about 30 days of the vernal equinox
> [@ossendrijver2016translating, 131]

The year could either have 12 or 13 months depending on if there was an intercalary month. 
A list of intercalary months mentioned in texts was published by Parker and Dubberstein [@dubberstein1956babylonian, 4]

### Lunar Month

> Day 1 of the new month was declared at the first appearance of the lunar crescent after sunset...
> The only attested month lengths are 29 days and 30 days, because day 1 was declared no later than the sunset at the
> end of day 30, irrespective of whether the crescent was then observed or not. 
> [@ossendrijver2016translating, 131]

> Our calculation shows that 7.5° (±0.25 ̊) is the lowest naked eye visibility limit.
> [@sultan2007visibility, 58]

I will take into account the following constraints:

- The month may not start earlier than the first possible day of lunar visibility, however it may start one day later.
- Each month can either be 29 or 30 days long, unless a dated text confirms the month was 30 days long.

## Planetary Visibilty

When computing planetary visibility events I am using the default fixed arcus visionis parameters
that are used in Alcyone Planetary, Stellar and Lunar Visibility [@alcyoneplsv].

## Conversions

### Angular Separation

> Our results for the angular equivalent of the finger and cubit in the Neo-Babylonian period are respectively 0.092 
> and 2.2 deg
> [@fatoohi1997angular, 212]

Where the diaries translate to "halo" I will map this to a 22° radius.

> The larger type of halo called supūru is not so far attested in diaries.
> [@sachs1988adt, 33]

### Constellations

Where the tablets describe a body as being within a constellation, I will approximate that position
by drawing an appropriate radius around a central star within that constellation. 

- Pisces: Centre: 58 Piscium, Radius: 50°
- Aries: Centre: Nu Arietis, Radius: 30°
