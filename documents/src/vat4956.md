## Planet Identification

> I have found that all the names attested for the seven planets in the period c. 750-612 BC
can be placed into five categories. ~ D Brown [@brown2000mesopotamian, 54]

> A - Names unique to the planet ( amongst celestial bodies) and which can be used under any
  circumstances.

> B - Names shared only with other planets and usable under any circumstances

| Name      | Identity                             | Category |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| Sagmegar  | Jupiter                              | A        |
| Delebat   | Venus                                | A        |
| Ṣalbatānu | Mars                                 | A        |

it can be dated.

My results match those of AJ Sachs and H Hunger.

All observations matched -567 except for Obv. Line 3 (9/I/37) where the Moon was 11.1° behind β Virginis (-567 April 30),
however the observation would have matched for the 8th on -567 April 29 where the Moon is 3.8° ahead of β Virginis.
In Sachs and Hunger's translation they have written `Night of the 9th (error for: 8th)`
