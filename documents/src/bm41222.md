Because there are only a few observations associated with each king, the results are not highly conclusive by themselves.
However knowing that Shamash-shum-ukin ruled for 20 years and Kandalanu 22 years 
(actually 21, and a year with no king), then we can test the results as a group:

These results differ very marginally from Hunger [@hunger2001adt, 151] who starts Shamash-shum-ukin's 17th year
one month earlier in March instead of April, and therefore obtains `19/II/17 = -650 April 28`, I consider either option
to be a good match.
