## Observations

> The text lists the dates of successive first and last visibilities of Saturn in terms of the regnal year, month
> and day in the lunar calendar.

> The planet is nowhere named on the tablet, but the intervals between the various observations (both chronologically
> and in terms of ecliptic longitude) fit the movements of Saturn and of no other planet.

## Results

When testing years in the range -697 to -596 the best match for Kandalanu's 1st year is -646, it is obviously very
close at the top, but in the context of the other texts in this project the -646 date matches up.
