## Observations

> The text lists the dates of successive first and last visibilities of Saturn in terms of the regnal year, month
> and day in the lunar calendar.

> The planet is nowhere named on the tablet, but the intervals between the various observations (both chronologically
> and in terms of ecliptic longitude) fit the movements of Saturn and of no other planet.
