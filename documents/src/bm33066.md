Note that the dates above assume there was a month XII₂ in the 7th year (as described in the text), and therefore
not in the 8th year.

## Discussion

There appear to be some anomalies in the text [@britton2008remarks, 9]:

1. There are numerous references to an intercalary Addaru (XII₂) in the 7th year of Cambyses,
however all other evidence shows that year 5 and 8 were intercalary years, but not year 7.
   
2. The planetary synodic phenomena observations reference a 9th year of Cambyses, despite
the fact that Cambyses died during his 8th year.

### The Lunar Six

> All Lunar Four data of year 7 of Cambyses are recorded on the tablet Cambyses 400. 
  Not all of these data can have been observed; some of them must have been predicted or calculated. 
  But a check has shown that they are surprisingly accurate. 
  Therefore I have always thought that the not-observed data might have been found by means of the Goal-Year method. 
  Now the Goal-Year method for finding missing data for Cambyses year 7 would use data stemming from the year situated 
  one Saros = 18 years earlier, namely from Nabunaid year 15. This year did have a month XII₂. This fact 
  could explain the recording of a month XII₂ in year 7 of Cambyses, a year which other sources show did not have an 
  extra month XII. Similar irregularities are seen in some of the Goal-Year tablets. For example: the Lunar Four 
  data expected for month XII₂ in year SE 96 could be found by means of the lunar data from the month one Saros 
  earlier, namely month I of Year SE 79. These data were, however, recorded in the Goal- Year tablet for 
  year SE 96 under the label of the non-existing month XII₂ of year SE 78. The occurrence of the non-existing 
  month XII₂ in Cambyses year 7 might indicate that the Goal-Year method really was known and used that early.
  [@brack2001astral, 246]

The obverse contains an almost complete series of lunar six data, however these
are unlikely to all be observations; in the real world some of the 78 intervals
would not have been observable due to weather conditions [@hunger1999astral, 174].
They would therefore have to be computed, and it is possible that the XII₂ was erroneously
introduced in the process.
