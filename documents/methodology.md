### Lunar Year

> The beginning of the year, day 1 of Nisannu (month I), always fell
> within about 30 days of the vernal equinox \[1, p. 131\]

The year could either have 12 or 13 months depending on if there was an
intercalary month. I am using this list of known intercalary months:

-   Shamash-shum-ukin Year 14, Addaru II: BM 29496, YBC 11309
-   Kandalanu Year 5, Ululu II: Clay BE 8/1, No.3,
    [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md) Obv. 10
-   Kandalanu Year 8, Ululu II: [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md) Obv. 15
-   Kandalanu Year 10, Addaru II: BM 54213,
    [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md) Rev. 20
-   Kandalanu Year 19, Addaru II: YBC 11481, 11300, 11476, NBC 6144
-   Nabopolassar Year 2, Addaru II: NCBT 589
-   Nabopolassar Year 5, Ululu II: UET IV 202
-   Nabopolassar Year 7, Addaru II: YBC 3455
-   Nabopolassar Year 10, Ululu II: GCCI II 50, NBC 6141
-   Nabopolassar Year 12, Addaru II: Unpub. economic text (Sachs)
-   Nabopolassar Year 15, Ululu II: TCL XII 19, NCBT 1175

### Lunar Month

> Day 1 of the new month was declared at the first appearance of the
> lunar crescent after sunset… The only attested month lengths are 29
> days and 30 days, because day 1 was declared no later than the sunset
> at the end of day 30, irrespective of whether the crescent was then
> observed or not. \[1, p. 131\]

> Our calculation shows that 7.5° (±0.25 ̊) is the lowest naked eye
> visibility limit. \[4, p. 58\]

I will take into account the following constraints:

-   The month may not start earlier than the first possible day of lunar
    visibility, however it may start one day later.
-   Each month can either be 29 or 30 days long (unless a dated text
    confirms the month was 30 days long).

Planetary Visibilty
-------------------

When computing planetary visibility events I am using the default fixed
arcus visionis parameters that are used in Alcyone Planetary, Stellar
and Lunar Visibility \[5\].

Conversions
-----------

### Angular Separation

> Our results for the angular equivalent of the finger and cubit in the
> Neo-Babylonian period are respectively 0.092 and 2.2 deg \[6, p. 212\]

Where the diaries translate to “halo” I will map this to a 22° radius.

> The larger type of halo called supūru is not so far attested in
> diaries. \[7, p. 33\]

### Constellations

Where the tablets describe a body as being within a constellation, I
will approximate that position by drawing an appropriate radius around a
relatively central star within that constellation. We can only take an
approximate approach anyway given that we do not have strict boundaries
for the ancient constellations.

Translations
------------

The general conventions used for most of the translations \[7, p. 37\]:

-   Square brackets `[]` denote missing/reconstructed text
-   Half brackets `⌜⌝` denote text damaged in some other way
-   A question mark indicates doubts about the reading of a sign

As a general rule I will not rely on reconstructed text for use in
analysing the observations; I will treat those sections as if they were
missing. There are some exceptions to this, such as where it is possible
to deduce information about the missing text from its surroundings, for
example:

-   Where a year/month/day number is missing or damaged we can assume
    that if the text is in order then the missing number will fit within
    the range of adjacent lines
-   [BM76738](./bm76738_76813.md) follows a consistent pattern where
    every other line is the last/first appearance, and every two lines
    spans a year.
