Methodology
===========

Calendar
--------

### Lunar Year

> The beginning of the year, day 1 of Nisannu (month I), always fell
> within about 30 days of the vernal equinox \[1, p. 131\]

The year could either have 12 or 13 months depending on if there was an
intercalary month. A list of intercalary months mentioned in texts was
published by Parker and Dubberstein \[2, p. 4\]

### Lunar Month

> Day 1 of the new month was declared at the first appearance of the
> lunar crescent after sunset… The only attested month lengths are 29
> days and 30 days, because day 1 was declared no later than the sunset
> at the end of day 30, irrespective of whether the crescent was then
> observed or not. \[1, p. 131\]

> Our calculation shows that 7.5° (±0.25 ̊) is the lowest naked eye
> visibility limit. \[3, p. 58\]

I will take into account the following constraints:

-   The month may not start earlier than the first possible day of lunar
    visibility, however it may start one day later.
-   Each month can either be 29 or 30 days long, unless a dated text
    confirms the month was 30 days long.

Planetary Visibilty
-------------------

When computing planetary visibility events I am using the default fixed
arcus visionis parameters that are used in Alcyone Planetary, Stellar
and Lunar Visibility \[4\].

Conversions
-----------

### Angular Separation

> Our results for the angular equivalent of the finger and cubit in the
> Neo-Babylonian period are respectively 0.092 and 2.2 deg \[5, p. 212\]

Where the diaries translate to “halo” I will map this to a 22° radius.

> The larger type of halo called supūru is not so far attested in
> diaries. \[6, p. 33\]

### Constellations

Where the tablets describe a body as being within a constellation, I
will approximate that position by drawing an appropriate radius around a
central star within that constellation.

-   Pisces: Centre: 58 Piscium, Radius: 50°
-   Aries: Centre: Nu Arietis, Radius: 30°
