Chronology
----------

According to H Hunger \[3, p. 391\] this tablet is part of a series that
are:

> arranged in columns such that each entry in a column is separated from
> the entry in the preceding column by one Saros of 18 years

So although the regnal names are missing in columns IV and V, for the
purposes of computation they can just be computed as continuations of
Nebuchadnezzar’s reign (under the standard chronology 50 Nebuchadnezzar
= 1 Nabonidus, and 68 Nebuchadnezzar = 2 Cyrus).

Results
-------

When testing years in the range -640 to -490 the best match for
Nebuchadnezzar’s 14th year is -590.
