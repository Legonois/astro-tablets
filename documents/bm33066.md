Discussion
----------

There do appear to be some problems with the text \[6, p. 9\]:

1.  There are numerous references to an intercalary Addaru (XII₂) in the
    7th year of Cambyses, however all other evidence shows that year 5
    and 8 were intercalary years, but not year 7.

2.  The planetary synodic phenomena observations reference a 9th year of
    Cambyses, despite the fact that Cambyses died during his 8th year.

3.  “The planetary data are uneven and generally of poor quality”

### The Lunar Six

> them must have been predicted or calculated. But a check has shown
> that they are surprisingly accurate. Therefore I have always thought
> that the not-observed data might have been found by means of the

> Saros = 18 years earlier, namely from Nabunaid year 15. This year did
> have a month XII₂. This fact could explain the recording of a month
> XII₂ in year 7 of Cambyses, a year which other sources show did not
> have an extra month XII. Similar irregularities are seen in some of

> from the month one Saros earlier, namely month I of Year SE 79. These
> data were, however, recorded in the Goal- Year tablet for year SE 96
> under the label of the non-existing month XII₂ of year SE 78. The
> occurrence of the non-existing month XII₂ in Cambyses year 7 might
> indicate that the Goal-Year method really was known and used that
> early. \[8, p. 246\]

The obverse contains an almost complete series of lunar six data,
however these are unlikely to all be observations; in the real world
some of the 78 intervals would not have been observable due to weather
conditions \[7, p. 174\]. They would therefore have to be computed, and
it is possible that the XII₂ was erroneously introduced in the process.

### Lunar Eclipses

> the magnitude reported for the First eclipse—“a little remaining to
> totality”—is grossly wrong, since the eclipse was partial with an
> actual magnitude of only slightly more than six digits. A possible
> explanation is that the magnitude was taken from an accurate record of
> the eclipse which occurred three Saroi earlier in Year 28 of
> Nebuchadnezzar (-576), a year with an intercalary XII₂ month. The
> magnitude of this eclipse—11.9 digits—agrees precisely with the
> description “a little remaining to totality” reported in the text.
> \[6, p. 29\]

### Summary

> In short, from such considerations and the several archaic conventions
> reflected in the text, it seems likely that the text was written
> during the span of its contents, perhaps towards the end of year 7 and
> that it drew extensively on Goal Year methods and earlier records for
> some of the data it reports. That the text should place a XII₂ month
> in year 7 remains an anomaly under any dating, but an incompetent one
> if the text were written after year 7 and one seemingly at odds with
> the consistent quality of the Lunar Six. Similarly the reference to a
> year 9 Cambyses, would be incompetent if the text were written after
> Darius’s reign was established, but a simple extrapolation if written
> during the reign of Cambyses. \[6, p. 10\]
